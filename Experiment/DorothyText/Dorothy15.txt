#####Dorothy managed to twist her head around and found it was the second
button on the jacket--the wolf's head--which had spoken to her.
#####'What will Crinklink do with me?' she asked anxiously.
#####'No one knows. You must wait and see,' replied the wolf.
#####'Some of his captives he whips,' squeaked the weasel's head.
#####'Some he transforms into bugs and other things,' growled the bear's
head.
#####'Some he enchants, so that they become doorknobs,' sighed the cat's
head.
